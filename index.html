    <h2>Re: Marquise Piton Eastern Kentucky Application</h2>
    Dear Marquise,

    <p>Thank you for your recent application to join us at Eastern Kentucky University's data science department to be one of our assistant professors as part of your Masters next year. I will answer you questions one by one, in the following sections.</p>

    <h3>Starting dates</h3>

    <p>We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if you could start at the beginning of a semester; the start dates for each one are as follows:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>First semester: 9 September 2021</li>
        <li>Second semester: 15 January 2022</li>
        <li>Third semester: 2 May 2022</li>
    </ul>
